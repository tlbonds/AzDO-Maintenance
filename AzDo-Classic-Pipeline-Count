# Replace these values with your own
$organization = "your-organization-name"
$project = "your-project-name"
$pat = "your-personal-access-token"

# Construct the REST API URL to get the list of pipelines
$url = "https://dev.azure.com/$organization/$project/_apis/pipelines?api-version=6.1-preview.1"

# Set the headers for the REST API request
$headers = @{
    Authorization = "Basic " + [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(":$pat"))
}

# Make the REST API request and convert the response to JSON
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Get -Headers $headers
$pipelines = $response.value | where {$_.pipelineType -eq "Build"}

# Filter out the classic pipelines
$classicPipelines = $pipelines | where {$_.repository.type -eq "TfsVersionControl"}

# Output the count of classic pipelines
Write-Host "Total number of classic pipelines: $($classicPipelines.count)"

You'll need to replace the $organization, $project, and $pat variables with your own values. You can generate a personal access token (PAT) in Azure DevOps by going to User Settings > Personal access tokens. The PAT should have at least the "Build (read)" scope to be able to access pipeline information.
