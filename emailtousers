Subject: End of Support for Deployment Group Agents on RHEL6

Dear Azure DevOps End Users,

We wanted to inform you that Microsoft Azure DevOps will no longer support Deployment Group Agents on RHEL6, effective immediately.

This decision was made because RHEL6 has reached its end of life, and continuing to support Deployment Group Agents on this operating system would expose our users to potential security vulnerabilities and other risks.

As a result, we highly recommend that you migrate your Deployment Group Agents to a supported operating system as soon as possible to ensure that you continue to receive all the benefits and security enhancements of Azure DevOps.

Please note that we will continue to support Deployment Group Agents on RHEL7 and newer versions, as well as other supported operating systems.

If you have any questions or concerns about this change, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter.

Best regards,

The Azure DevOps Team
